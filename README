The Fat Hactory Game! Yay!

To run just make clean && make then ./fathactory and you may enjoy the
splendor that is our game.

General Controls:

'ESC' at any time will exit the game.
'M' to return to the Main menu, or to skip the fade in intro
'P' to skip the cut scene
'WASD' to move, 'W' to jump
'Enter' to select menu options 

Options:
---------------
Pressing the "M" key at any time will return to Main menu. This is useful
for returning to the menu after dying or winning the game.

Play
-----
Use 'WASD' to jump and move. 'W' to jump. Colliding with enemies will lead to Kevin losing
health, when Kevin loses all his health he dies. :(

However, for this level Kevin is invincible. We have disabled the health to ensure ease
of testing.

Platforms can be jumped on by pressing 'W' underneath them or by running and jumping
on top of them.

In order to win and escape this factory, you have to dodge the demons
and reach the magical crown (located at the very top right of the screen). The crown can only be
reached in this level after the bunny hat is obtained. At the moment, running into the bunny
hat will grant Kevin SUPER JUMP POWERS! This allows Kevin to jump to skies and reach the crown.

Bunny hat is located on the ground floor near right side of the level.

Note: Bunny hat is still displayed after colliding with it, but don't worry, the jumping
power has been granted!

Now there is additional glamour hat hiding on the level which will cause a super cool rainbow strobe to appear on the screen. You will keep the powers of the bunny hat but you will see the disco hat on your head.

Bunny hat is located on the far right of the level.



Breakdown of what each member achieved:

Harry: Designed the first level, fixed small bug with collision with enemies and added kickback when an enemy bumps into you, changed the tile collision slightly so now you being next to a tile is different from being on it, implemented the disco hat abilities, made it so enemies are removed when they fall off the screen, and added button to get rid of damage.
