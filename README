The Fat Hactory Game! Yay!

To run just make clean && make then ./fathactory and you may enjoy the
splendor that is our game.

General Controls:
'ESC' at any time will exit the game.
'M' to return to the Main menu, or to skip the fade in intro (go to Main screen anytime)
'P' to skip the game backstory/intro cut scene
'Enter' to select menu options 


Game Controls:
'I' to make Kevin INVINCIBLE (so you don't die)
'U' to cheat and Auto-Win the level
'E' to pick up hat and wear it
'WASD' to move, 'W' to jump


Notes:
---------------
Pressing the "M" key at any time will return to Main menu. This is useful
for returning to the menu after dying or winning the game.

Options:
---------------
Selecting 'Options" from the menu leads to options screen. Currently there is one option "Background Music". When selected (use W/D to scroll through options) pressing the "A" key makes the background music quieter. Pressing "D" key increases the background music volume.

Play
-----
Use 'WASD' to jump and move. 'W' to jump. Colliding with enemies will lead to Kevin losing
health, when Kevin loses all his health he dies. :(

However, if you want to make Kevin invincible, press the 'I' key to ensure ease
of testing. :)

Platforms can be jumped on by pressing 'W' and jumping on top of them. You cannot jump on the platform
from underneath- you will collide with the bottom of the platform.

---------
CHAPTER 1
---------
In order to win and escape this factory, you have to dodge the demons
and reach the magical crown (located at the very top left of the screen). The crown can only be
reached in this level after the bunny hat is obtained. After obtaining the bunny hat, it will be displayed in
the top right hand of the screen (underneatH the health bar), and Kevin will be granted SUPER JUMP POWERS!
This allows Kevin to jump to the skies and reach the crown.

Bunny hat is located on the far right of the level. Press 'E' to pick the hat up to wear and gain super jump powers.

Now there is additional glamour hat hiding on the level which will cause a super cool rainbow strobe to appear on the screen.
You will keep the powers of the bunny hat but you will see the disco hat on your head. Press 'E' to pick up the disco hat.

--------
CHAPTER 2
--------
After winning Chapter 1 (by completing the level, or by pressing 'U' to auto-win), selecting "Play" again will load the second chapter.

Here we have a dark level where you need the "Miner Hat" in order to win. The "Miner Hat" is located at the very beginning of the level. Press 'E' to pick up the miner hat and light up the level!

This level is very tough so it will probably be easiest to press 'U' to win. However, if you want to challenge yourself and navigate through Chapter 2, the crown is located in the bottom right corner of the second level.
