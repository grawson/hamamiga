The Fat Hactory Game! Yay!

To run just make clean && make then ./fathactory and you may enjoy the
splendor that is our game. At any point while running the game 'esc'
will exit you to safety (sometimes this takes time but remember,
all good things come to those who wait).

The title screen will slowly fade in, if you find it too slow for your
tastes have a glass of wine and reflect on your own life. Once you reach 
the menu screen use 'w' and 's' to navigate through the different options 
and enter to select.

Options:

Play
-----
By choosing the play game option you are in for a world of excitement
of running around with enemies attempting to scythe you to death.
Use'WASD' to jump and move. Colliding with enemies will lead to Kevin losing
health. When he runs out of health he dies! (after 2 hits) :(
In order to win and escape this hell factory, you have to dodge the demons
and reach the magical crown!

High Scores
-----
'High Scores' is also filled with the past accomplishments of Kevin. The
score is based off of how long it takes Kevin to reach the crown and win. The
score is displayed while playing the game and can be seen afterwards in this
screen. Compete with fellow Kevins to see who can get the crown the fastest! :)

Options
-----
Currently 'options' is not implemented but that is where audio and
visual adjustments will go.

Quit
----
'quit' quits
