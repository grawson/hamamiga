The Fat Hactory Game! Yay!

To run just make clean && make then ./fathactory and you may enjoy the
splendor that is our game.

General Controls:

'ESC' at any time will exit the game.
'M' to return to the Main menu, or to skip the fade in intro (go to Main screen anytime)
'P' to skip the intro cut scene in game
'S' to make Kevin INVINCIBLE (so you don't die)
'WASD' to move, 'W' to jump
'Enter' to select menu options 

Options:
---------------
Pressing the "M" key at any time will return to Main menu. This is useful
for returning to the menu after dying or winning the game.

Play
-----
Use 'WASD' to jump and move. 'W' to jump. Colliding with enemies will lead to Kevin losing
health, when Kevin loses all his health he dies. :(

However, if you want to make Kevin invincible, press the 'S' key to ensure ease
of testing. :)

Platforms can be jumped on by pressing 'W' and jumping on top of them. You cannot jump on the platform
from underneath- you will collide with the bottom of the platform.

In order to win and escape this factory, you have to dodge the demons
and reach the magical crown (located at the very top left of the screen). The crown can only be
reached in this level after the bunny hat is obtained. After obtaining the bunny hat, it will be displayed in
the top right hand of the screen (underneat the health bar), and Kevin will be granted SUPER JUMP POWERS!
This allows Kevin to jump to the skies and reach the crown.

Bunny hat is located on the far right of the level.

Now there is additional glamour hat hiding on the level which will cause a super cool rainbow strobe to appear on the screen.
You will keep the powers of the bunny hat but you will see the disco hat on your head.


Breakdown of what each member achieved:

Harry: Designed the first level, fixed small bug with collision with enemies and added kickback when an enemy bumps into you, changed the tile collision slightly so now you being next to a tile is different from being on it, implemented the disco hat abilities, made it so enemies are removed when they fall off the screen, and added button to get rid of damage. 
Matt: Added more collision logic, made entire rendering system more efficient, added the logic for the intro
cut scenes.
Mindy: Fixed shortcuts to skip scenes, added soundsystem, added sounds for the game.
Gavi: Designed cut scenes, strobe hat, textured platforms, and updated the background graphic.
